# Rubik's Cube Simulator and Solver | My Tryst with Claude and Cursor

This project is a React-based Rubik's Cube simulator and solver. It provides a 3D visualization of a Rubik's Cube with interactive controls and solving capabilities.

## Features

- 3D visualization of a Rubik's Cube
- Interactive cube rotation controls (UI buttons and keyboard shortcuts)
- Cube scrambling
- Automatic solving with step-by-step visualization
- Keyboard shortcuts for face rotations

## Technologies Used

- React
- cubejs (for Rubik's Cube operations)
- CSS for 3D transformations
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production

## How to Use

- Use the on-screen buttons or keyboard shortcuts to rotate cube faces
- Click 'Scramble' to randomize the cube
- Click 'Solve' to watch the cube solve itself step-by-step

### Keyboard Controls

- Press U, D, F, B, L, R for clockwise rotations
- Hold Shift + key for counterclockwise rotations
